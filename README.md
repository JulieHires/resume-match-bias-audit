### Hi, I'm Julie!

I'm a startup recruiter with a technical backgroundâ€”I started my career as a network engineer and now help early-stage teams hire better (especially for technical roles).

I'm here to stay close to the tools and projects engineers actually care about.

Right now, Iâ€™m learning:
- How developers *really* work (beyond resumes)
- VibeCode (yes, Iâ€™m exploring the dev side!)
- How generative AI is changing workflows and tools

If youâ€™re building in that spaceâ€”or just sharing something coolâ€”Iâ€™d love to see it.
